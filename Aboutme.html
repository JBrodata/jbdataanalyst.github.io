							<p>
										Hello! I'm Jim and I am a data analyst that recently changed careers from owning a small business.
							</p>
							<p>
									Deciding to move on my from business was not an easy decision. My business was going well and I had built up a great list of Clients. But I had achieved what I set out to do 
									and I was burning the candle at both ends and the middle trying to keep up with the work. I decided that I was ready for a change, but it had to be something 
									that I loved. Looking at potential career paths made me realize that I had been a data analyst for the last 14 years, so it seemed like a natural fit. I had been using 
									SQL and Excel regularly for my business metrics and I was using data to make business decisions. It was the thing that I loved most about owning a small business. Seeing the
									revenue grow as predicted when I made a business change was incredibly satisfying. That is what I set out to do and I didn't stop until it happened. 
							</p>
							<p>
									I am now working as a full-time data analyst and I love getting to work with data everyday. Using SQL in a much bigger data environment allowded me to grow my skills and use 
									SQL in ways that I wasn't able to before. I also get the opportunity to extract data from many different sources and it is always a fun challenge transforming that data into 
									something that I need to work with. My eventual goal is to grow into an advanced data analyics role or data engineering.
							</p>
