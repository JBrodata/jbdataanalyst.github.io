							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<body>
							<p>
										Hello! I'm Jim and I am on an exciting journey from small landscaping business owner to full time data analyst. Deciding to make this career change 
									while juggling my family life and a successful business has not been easy, but I am not one to shy away from a challenge. 
							</p>
							<p>
									Once I decided that I was ready to move on from my business, I started looking at various career paths. Data Analytics stood out as a career that 
									seemed very interesting to me. I have always been a curious person and the idea of data telling a story and using that story to find the "a-ha" 
									moment is incredibly appealing to me. I also really enjoy problem solving, which was something that I have loved about running my business for the last 
									14 years, and also something that drew me to data analytics. 
							</p>
							<p>
									In the rare event that I am not running my business, working on my career change, or chipping away at my own honey-do list, I also enjoy taking my family to 
									Cape Cod or roaming the woods of NH with my 13 year old chocolate lab.
							</p>
